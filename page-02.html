		<h3>Objective Elements</h3>
		<p>First 25 Elements are Objective meaning Gross Elements, the five mahabhutas, <br>the five tanmatras, the five karmmdriyas, and the five jnanendriyas, are called gross elements. </p>
		

		<p> Lets begin from the Lowest degree of tatvas - <u>gross tatvas</u> <br>
		Famously known as <u>Pañca Mahābhūtās</u> <br>
		<br>
	        <span style="color: #fbb0b0;">
                pŗithvī = earth <br>
                jala = water <br> 
		tejas = fire <br>
		vāyu = air <br> 
	 	ākāśa = ether 
                </span>
		<br>

		Here ākāśa i.e ether element is not perceptible because it is unoccupied space.<br>
		It gives room to exist and move to the other perceptible gross elements. <br>
		Its like special vacume which filled with other gross elements. <br>
		<br>
		<div style="border:3px double white; padding: 10px;">
		These tatvas are gross and called Mahabhutas (great elemenents) because whole universe <br>
		is based on these elements.</div> <br>
		</p>
		<br>

		<strong>Pañcha Tanmätras — Five Subtle Elements</strong>
		<p> The five tanmatras correspond to the five mahdbhutas. </p>

		<strong>Pañca karmendriyas — Five organs of action</strong>

		<p>After the five tanmatras comes out the five tattvas which are known as the five karmendriyas, the five organs of action.<br>

		<strong>Pañca jnanendriyas — Five Organs of Cognition</strong>
		<p>The next five tattvas comprise what are known as the five organs of cognition, the five jnanendriyas means organs of knowledge. These are the mental organs with which we experience the world. </p>

		<h3>Objective cum Subjective Elements</h3>
		<p><small style="text-align: left">The following elements, as we continue rising in our explaination of the tattvas, are said to be objective cum subjective elements. You should understand though, that in saivism all the elements are really objective elements, they are called objects. Only that Super Being is subjective. Yet as the following elements are a bit more attached with subjectivity than the former we say that they are objective cum subjective elements.</small>
		</p>
	
		<strong>Antaḥkaraṇas — Three Internal Organs</strong>
		<p> Now we rise to the three tattvas which are known as the antahkaranas. The word ‘antahkararm’ means internal organs.</p>

			<tr>
					<td><span class="tooltip">buddhiḥ<p class="info">The action of buddhih tattva, the element of intellect, is to confirm whether I should do this or not. This is the field of the confirmation of the rightness of any proposed action whether intellectual or moral because first you must determine the rightness of a proposed decision or action and then you make a choice dependent on this rightness. You ask yourself internally, should I do this action or not, is this the right decision or not, and buddhi will reply to you, no, you should not do it, or yes, you should do it. This is bad, it is wrong to do it. This is good, you should do it. This answer is right, this answer is wrong, all this is done by the intellect.</p></span></td>

					<td><span class="tooltip">ahaṁkāra<p class="info">Ahamkara tattva is the element of ego which is connected with objectivity. When you attribute any action or knowledge to your own self such as, I have done this and I am mistaken, I have done that and I ought not to have done it, or I did a wonderful thing today which will benefit me alot, this is the action of ahamkara tattva. It creates limited “I” consciousness, the limited ego which is connected with objectivity.</p></span></td>

			<tr>
					<td><span class="tooltip">prakŗiti<p class="info large">Rising still further we come to the two tattvas prakriti and purusa. These two tattvas are interdependent. Prakrti is dependent upon purusa and purusa is dependent upon praknti. Prakriti is that element which is referred to and is known as “nature”. It is the field where the three tendencies arise and flow forth. These three tendencies are known as the three gunas, the three qualities, which are respectively satva, rajas, and tamas. Prakriti is the combination of these three gunas but without any distinction. The three gunas come out from prakriti, and so it is said that the three gunas are not in the field of the tattvas, they are not to be considered as tattvas, because they are created by prakriti. Tattvas are creators, they are not created. Therefore, it is not the gunas which are tattvas but their creator prakriti. And that which responds to that prakriti, which owns that prakriti is called purusa.</p></span></td>

			<tr>
				<td>puruşa</td>
				<td>ego (subjective)</td>

		<div style="border: 1px solid #b5a1e4; padding: 10px;">
		<p>In saivism, purusa is not a realized soul. Purusa tattva is bound and limited just as ahamkdra lallva is. The only 1 difference that exists between purusa and ahamkara is that (purusa is connected with subjectivity and ahamkara is connected with objectivity. And this purusa is entangled and bound in five ways which are the five kancukas niyati, kala, raga, vidya and kala.</p>
		</div>

		<br>
		<div style="border:3px double white; padding: 10px;">
           All of these 24 tattvas exist in the field of maya, in the field of objectivity.

			These five tattvas plus maya are six tattvas which are known as sat kancukas (the six fold coverings). These are the six coverings which bind and entangle and, therefore, limit purusa. He is not limited by only one covering but by six coverings and these coverings must be removed, uncovered, and this is done automatically by the grace of the Master. And through this grace, at the time of real knowledge maya is transformed into His sakti. His great energy. In His glory maya becomes the glory of Parama Siva. When purusa realizes the reality of his nature, maya becomes glory for him.

			<small>And last is that Being which does not come in the cycle of tattvas. That Being is called </small><span style="color: #cba4d9;">Parama siva</span><small>. Parama Siva is not only found in siva tattva or only found in sakti tattva, it is not only here, it is not only there, </small><span style="color: #cba4d9;">everywhere you will find it.</span><small> You will find it from the lowest tattva to the highest tattva. It is all level that is why It is no level. It is every where, that is why It is nowhere. The one Being who is everywhere It is nowhere.</small>
